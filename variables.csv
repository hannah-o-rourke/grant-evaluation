Do editors who are politically polarised do enough to update these important pages?        a few academics        If you made it a focus to better update information on politicians ahead of the elections that could help people better understand the people they are voting for.

I guess its like a more formalised democracy club except that is for candidates too - is there an in built disadvantage to candidates if only the incumbent is covered on wikipedia?

I think it could be important for elections - would be good to formalise this process so information is fairer and less just about editors biases.        Money to create a volunteer group to do this?
